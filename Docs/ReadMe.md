# 3D Scanning Workflow using Microsoft HoloLens 2 & Grasshopper

This repository provides a Grasshopper-based workflow that enables 3D scanning of physical artifacts using Microsoft HoloLens 2. The workflow converts scanned data into point clouds for real-time visualization and further geometric processing within Grasshopper.
